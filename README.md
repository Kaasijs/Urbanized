# Urbanized (GameJam Archive)

This short game was made for the Urban Jam. Your purpose in life is to put art on walls and get the starred spray can, all while avoiding being caught by the police drone. Getting caught isn’t very stylish, after all.
The game is very unfinished an i probably will never finish this one.

Stuff I wanted to add but didnt have time for:
  - GTA-style star-based system for the police drones
  - More variety in shop items
  - Custom art painting (so at the start of the game you’d draw your own street signature)
  - Way more sounds
  - A background
  - Lighting
  - Good controller support 

Credits:
  - I bought and used ZeggyGames’s 2D player pixel art as a base for the cool guy. The rest was all me and Godot. :)

Thank you to Prendo Fuoco for hosting the jam!

All assest are free to use for all.
